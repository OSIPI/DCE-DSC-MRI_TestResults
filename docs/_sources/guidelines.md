# Want to contribute?

The code collection is an ongoing project. Contributions on different levels are always very welcome.
We have now collected the most basic functionalities, but we are aiming to include also more advanced analysis methods or different implementations of already existing subcategories.
In addition, the scientific testing can also be extended. The current test data is limited and might not cover all ranges of data. 

If you would like to contribute to this part of the OSIPI initiative please email the contacts listed on our [website](https://www.osipi.org/task-force-2-3/).

More detailed information about contributing code, the testing approach, etc can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection/wiki) of the github repository.
